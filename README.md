A clean archeticure modular iOS space news app built with SwiftUI and powered by Swift Concurrency. I developed it as a hands-on learning experience to solidify and apply the technical concepts Iâ€™ve been studying.

By combining a real-world use case with modern development practices, this app serves as both a portfolio project to showcase my technical skills and a personal milestone in my iOS development learning journey.
